## looping over an array using forEach method
for example we we wanna loop over a movments array .
```javascript
movments.forEach(function(movment)){
}
```
**forEach method requires a callback function**in order to tell what to do 
* *its the foreach method that will call this callback function.* *
  forEach method loop over an array and in each iteration it will execute the call back function.
