## looping over an array using forEach method
for example we we wanna loop over a movments array .
```javascript
movments.forEach(function(movment)){
}
```
**forEach method requires a callback function**in order to tell what to do 
* *its the foreach method that will call this callback function.* *
  forEach method loop over an array and in each iteration it will execute the call back function.
  also as the forEach method calls this callback function,in each iteration it will pass in the current element of the array as an argument.
